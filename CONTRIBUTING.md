## How To Contribute

Hello! Firstly, make sure you have a github account. Once you've modified the code and added/changed what you desire, create a new pull request and list all you have added/changed/etc.

I will review your request and merge if it's fit to do so, you may also fork this repo if I don't merge into it.
